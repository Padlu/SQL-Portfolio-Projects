# SQL Portfolio Projects for Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, and Data Querying

`(Any points in here?)`

## Project 1: Data Exploration using SQL.

**Experience Level:** Intermediate

**SQL Skills used:** Creating Views, CTE's, Temp tables, Joins, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types

**Technology used:** T-SQL (SQL Server Management System)

**Objective:**
* To explore the Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations Data using SQL
* To fool around the dataset to use SQL skills
*  Dataset is gathered from '[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)'


**Summary:**
1. In this project, I worked to query the given dataset to answer simple questions of which a few are:
    1. Likelihood of dying if you contract COVID in India
    2. What countries have the highest infection rate compared to population
    3. Comparison of death rates for countries: India, Ireland, United States and Norway
    4. What is Global Death % per day
    5. How many people in all locations have been vaccinated
    6. What is Rolling TotalVaccinations % per population (Windows Function, CTE/Temp table)
2. This simple project focused on above mentioned SQL skills to be used on the given dataset.
3. This project demonstrates advance queries like combination of PARTITION BY clause with JOIN, CTE and Temp tables and to create VIEWS for later use and queries with GROUP BY, WHERE, ORDER BY, and aggregation functions.
4. Required queried tables for Tableau Vizualisation are saved using views.

## Project 2: Data Cleaning using SQL.

**Experience Level:** Intermediate

**SQL Skills used:** JOINS, CTE, ISNULL(), String Functions, conditional CASE statement, Converting data types, RENAME, UPDATE, ALTER TABLE, DROP

**Technology used:** T-SQL (SQL Server Management System)

**Objective:**
* To perform simple Data Cleaning for Nashville Housing Data using SQL
* To fool around the dataset to use SQL skills


**Summary:**
1. The project performs following data cleaning tasks:
    1. Standardizing Date format of SaleDate field
    2. Populating NULL entries with correct values in Property Address field
    3. Split the full Address into 3 column parts of (Street, City, and State) for more usability
    4. Standardizing values in SoldAsVacant field for consistent data
    5. Removed Duplicate entries
    6. Dropped Unused/non-required columns
3. This simple project focused on above mentioned SQL skills to be used on the given dataset.
4. This project demonstrates useful queries like JOIN,conditional CASE, PARTITION BY clause with CTE, GROUP BY, WHERE, ORDER BY, RENAME, UPDATE, ALTER TABLE, DROP, String functions and aggregation functions.

* Future: Use other SQL tools such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, etc to perform same projects.
